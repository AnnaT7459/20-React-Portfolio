# React Portfolio

## Description
As I begin looking for employment, I want an employer to see that I have experience building single-page applications. I want employers to see my portfolio of work samples so they can determine that I am a good candidate for an open position. I learned a lot by apply the React skills I learned in class. I liked getting back into CSS and using bootstrap to create a mobile-first design.
